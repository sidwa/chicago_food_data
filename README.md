Analysis of Chicago food inspection data

The complain plot is a graph which shows the fraction of inspections due to complains which resulted in fail result on 
food inspection among the total number of inpsections that were carried out due to customer complaints, for different
category of places where food is sold. But among 100+ the categories only 
the top 10 categories which had the most number of complaints were taken into consideration for this plot.  
On the x-axis Categories are sorted from most amount of complains(on the left) to fewer complains on the right.

The non-complain plot is a graph where instead of finding fraction of inspections due to complains we inspect fraction
of routine inspections which resulted in a fail result. Among the same categories sorted on number of routine inspections
done on those category of places. So the category on the left of x-axis has had the most number of routine inspections while
the category on the right has 10th most number of routine inspections.
